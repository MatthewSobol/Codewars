Codewars Concept:

Codewars is a Starcraft-Like Battleground with units and buildings, yet

- The movement, attack and building functions are driven by your own code!
- The better code(r) wins!

Structure:
- Server / Client application
- Client is an api for a programming language and the server, and has a visualisation function for the battelground
- The server part is called the "battleground"

Planned:
- POC (coming soon)
- Api for Python and C++ (more to come later)

May the better code win!
